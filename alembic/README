Alembic migration helpers
=========================

Create a new revision based on model changes:

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Short description"
```

Apply the latest migrations to the configured database:

```
alembic upgrade head
```

Both commands rely on ``FP_DB_URL`` (or the default SQLite path) and use the
SQLModel metadata imported in ``alembic/env.py``.
